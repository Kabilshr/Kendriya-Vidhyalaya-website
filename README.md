## About
The KV School Website is a collaborative project aimed at modernizing the digital presence and functionality of Kendriya Vidyalaya (KV) School, leveraging Django (Python), HTML, and CSS. This repository houses the codebase developed by a team of three participants.

Due to logistical challenges, the website is temporarily hosted on ['Kabil06.pythonanywhere.com'](http://kabil06.pythonanywhere.com) currently. It is intended to eventually replace the official KV School website at ['kvkathmandu.net'](http://kvkathmandu.net).
